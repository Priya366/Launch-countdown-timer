## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design 
- JavaScript (Date objects, function, ternary operator, setTimeout, DOM). 

### What I learned

After understanding Date (built-in-objects) in Javascript , I accepted this challenge. 

It was quite overwhelming at first, but I broke the problems in little parts and start solving them.

I googled some questions to find proper solutions like how to convert milliseconds to get dates or time.
